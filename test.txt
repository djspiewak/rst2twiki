Test Header
===========

This is some test text in the first paragraph.  Here we have *italic*.  Here we
have **bold**.  I can do `some linking`_, even with a single word_.  Oh yeah,
don't forget ``pre-formatted text``.  We can even preformat a paragraph::

    case node @ <target></target> => {
      val id = node \ "@refid"
      
      if (id.length > 0) {
        result += '#' + processId(id.text) + '\n'
      }
    }

And here's paragraph 2!  Dig the nifty "quotes".  Have I forgotten anything?

Yes, I did forget something: special characters!  Let's try a few: &, <, >, !.
We can even try a few special blocks: %TOC%, !test, OutsideBrackets, 
[[InsideBrackets]].  Let's also see what happens when we try an email@address.com
Another interesting thing would be tags: <like> </this>.
